\chapter{Image processing techniques for increasing the performance of classification algorithms}

Because the machine learning classification algorithms did not produce very good results for image classification it was decided to explore additional image processing techniques. After taking a look at the food images in the dataset it was observed that in all food images there were a lot of.

Questions:

1. Image processing -> no results were used
2. Structure.
