Objectives of the project were to practically understand machine learning algorithms that can be used for classifying images. To accomplish this  task   a suitable food image dataset was found and images were preprocessed. Then  image classifiers using various machine learning algorithms were built.  Finally, these classifiers were trained  on  the accumulated dataset and  their performances were evaluated.

\section{Lessons Learnt}

During the progress of this project, it was gradually discovered why image classification is such a hard problem.  The problem that algorithms in image recognition task face  is that images are very dynamic and are susceptible to different kind of variations. It was practically observed that machine learning algorithms that are   successfully  used in practice for tasks such as spam detection, credit card fraud detection and other tasks were unable to classify images with a high enough accuracy.  It was also observed that machine learning algorithms take a very long time to train. This is  a  main barrier for using machine learning techniques for vision. Overall, the project was successful. A framework for converting pictures to the dataset of images was built, different classification algorithms were successfully tried and evaluated.

\section{Limitations}
The main limitation of the project was that machine learning algorithms take a very long time to train. Images are very high dimensional data, and an enormous amount of the computing power is required to train a good machine learning model for image classification. Therefore, this project was limited to using only four image classes. These four classes are not able to represent all types of food that are eaten by people.

The second limitation that was faced during this project was that it was not possible to explore larger deep learning networks on the hardware setup  used. Because of that, a maximum  accuracy score that could be reached by the  deep neural network and the  convolutional neural network was not achieved. With deeper architectures of neural networks it would be plausible to get  better accuracy scores.

\section{Future Work}

For extending this project, one classification method should be explored more thoroughly. Then, a classifier that distinguishes between a greater amounts of food classes should be built using this model.   A convolutional neural network would be the most promising model to explore further because it achieved high accuracy score. Also, researchers have proven that a convolutional neural network is the best method that can be used for image classification. Furthermore, there here has not been much research done about  a food classification with convolutional neural networks.  A good number of classes for a new model would be around 100 classes of most popular dishes.  Because of the increased complexity a GPU cluster will be needed to train this model. If this new model achieved the high accuracy rate, it would be possible to use this model in dietary assessment applications.
