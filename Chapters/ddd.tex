The aims of the project are to explore the machine learning algorithms that could be used for food image classification and systematically evaluate different these algorithms and their performance.

7.	Conclusions: VERY important chapter. Revisit your objectives from the Introduction.  For each, analyse whether the project met that objective, and if not, discuss this, and suggest a solution. Discuss the project as a whole, if you did it again would you do it differently? What did you have to learn to do the project, what did you learn from doing it? What features would you add to your system if you had more time etc? Some suggested subsections for your concluding chapter are: Review of aims; Suggested revisions to design/implementation; Future work (possible developments of existing system); Lessons learned. Finish the concluding chapter with a brief, fairly upbeat overall conclusion on the project as a whole. Even projects that are not an overall success usually achieve something, and you acquire skills and knowledge from doing the project. End on a positive note
