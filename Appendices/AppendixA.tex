\chapter{A Computer System used for the project}

Performance of Machine Learning algorithms can be directly mapped to a computing power of a computer system used. With more computing power it is possible to train algorithms using more training data or with using a bigger set of features. Because of that it is important to show the parameters and limitations of the computer system used.
