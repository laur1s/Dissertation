The dissertation focuses on computer vision techniques for classifying food objects from images. The dataset of food images was accumulated. Then, different machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors classifier, support vector machine, linear classifier, multilayer neural network, convolutional neural network, and transfer learning were explored. The classifiers that use these algorithms were developed. To evaluate the classification performance accuracy score of each classifier was calculated. The method that worked best, transfer learning, achieved 98.20 percent accuracy on the test dataset. It was concluded that food classification from images with reasonable accuracy was possible and deep learning models work much better for this task, compared to the other machine learning techniques.

I would like to thank my project supervisor, Adrian Friday for guidance and valuable feedback provided for the project and the final report.

I would like to thank Christian Bizer who taught a data mining course at the University of Mannheim when I studied there. This course introduced me to data mining and machine learning algorithms and aroused my interest in the subject.

I would like to thank Andrej Karpathy who was a lecturer at Stanford's CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course. He made all the lecture recordings and the course material publicly available which were a great learning resource. I believe that public availability is a huge step in democratizing education and in some sense AI.

I would like to thank my family for believing that I could study computer science at university and for supporting and encouraging me.

Finally, I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my sister, Aiste.
